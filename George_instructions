Dear New Guardian,

Welcome to the unique journey of caring for George, our cherished Tamagotchi. As his previous guardians embark on new paths, they entrust you with George, a digital companion with a story interwoven with their own.

Here's a succinct guide to ensure George's well-being in his pixelated world:

Feeding:
When George is hungry, he'll make a specific noise (__________). Respond by pressing the button to feed him, bringing warmth and nourishment to his digital life.

Sleep:
George will also signal when he's tired with a distinct sound (__________). Hold the button for 2 seconds to help him drift into a restful sleep, replenishing his energy for new adventures.

Stress Relief:
If the digital world weighs heavily on him, offer George a cigarette to alleviate his stress, a quirky legacy from his past.

Health Monitoring:
Keep an eye on the RGB light atop George's domain. Green signifies robust health, while red urges caution. Tread carefully, as health, once declined, is a precious commodity to reclaim.
