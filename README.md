Introduction Recipe Notes

1.)	Context
-	Introduce Crossmoddal correspondences, idea of double empathy maybe.
   
2.)	The motivation
-	Extends previous research, provides basis for more research.
-	Further explore the use of different shapes to potentially identify others, like kiki and bouba.
  
3.)	Show how relate work DOES not cover this.
-	“Like Popcorn” paper, Researcher did this but not that. Point our differences.
-	Note add papers.
-	Talk about methods of expeirments -> mostly younger ages tested on
  
4.)	The solution / method / results
-	Outline method and steps -> theory, assembly, materials, ideas etc.
-	For surveying, explain results -> how they contributed to to experience

5.)	How does the solution enable further research
-	Concept is not new, but the mode of interaction is new.
-	Show potential for further research.
-	Show what this research extends.

Samples of Abstract/Intro from Anne

- In our world today, we often overlook the amazing ways our senses work together. Research in crossmodal correspondences have for example shown how our senses, like sight, smell, and touch, connect deeply with our emotions. For example, boubou kiki ...
 
- But most people don't know about these connections because the information is usually in academic papers or boring exhibits. What if we could change that and make learning about our senses fun, engaging and interactive?
 
- We contribute an exhibition where people don't just look at stuff—you actually play with it! Visitors can touch and feel objects that represent different senses. By putting these objects into special slots on a table, they can see how each one makes them feel.
 
- We evaluate our exhibition ... blabla. But beyond this we also showcase how it can become a valuable platform for research, generating firsthand data on how individuals perceive and respond to sensory stimuli.
