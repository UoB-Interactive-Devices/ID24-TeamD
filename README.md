# Idea
A device to display "compatibility" between 2 users by playing a game in which users place a shape based on an emotion on a screen.

## Writing

500 words a day = GET PUBLISHED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Options, Decision, Why -> Formula for Paper writing 

Abstract and Intro (clarity) (10) - Oliver - 1000 words
-	Introduce Crossmoddal correspondences, idea of double empathy maybe.

Related work / originality (15) - Mekyle / Tom - 1500 words
-	Extends previous research, provides basis for more research.
-	Further explore the use of different shapes to potentially identify others, like kiki and bouba.
-	“Like Popcorn” paper, Researcher did this but not that. Point our differences.
-	Note add papers.
-	Talk about methods of expeirments -> mostly younger ages tested on

Study 1: User gathering data (10) - Yousuf - 1000 words
- Talk about results of first survey
- How we chose the shapes etc...
- Results of 2nd survey how this influenced what shapes we chose for final project

Design and implementation (15) - Badr - 1500
-	Outline method and steps
- theory, assembly, materials, ideas etc.

Study 2: Device evaluation (15) - Tom -> since this is later - 1500
-	Concept is not new, but the mode of interaction is new.
-	Show potential for further research.
-	Show what this research extends.

FIRST PROTOTYPE 13/3/24


Samples of Abstract/Intro from Anne

- In our world today, we often overlook the amazing ways our senses work together. Research in crossmodal correspondences have for example shown how our senses, like sight, smell, and touch, connect deeply with our emotions. For example, boubou kiki ...
 
- But most people don't know about these connections because the information is usually in academic papers or boring exhibits. What if we could change that and make learning about our senses fun, engaging and interactive?
 
- We contribute an exhibition where people don't just look at stuff—you actually play with it! Visitors can touch and feel objects that represent different senses. By putting these objects into special slots on a table, they can see how each one makes them feel.
 
- We evaluate our exhibition ... blabla. But beyond this we also showcase how it can become a valuable platform for research, generating firsthand data on how individuals perceive and respond to sensory stimuli.

##TO DO :
- [X] Tom & Mekyle  - Reduce orginal survey down to 6 shapes
- [X] Tom & Mekyle - Make new survey - 1) add option for other and let them write 2) add option for neutral 'no emotion' 3) choose 2 contraversial and one non contraversial for new models
- [ ] Tom - Build seperating screen
- [ ] Tom - Build shape holder
- [ ] Tom - Draw up some designs
      
- [ ] Baddr - 3D modelling and print, after second survey complete, and 3 new shapes have been chosen.
- [ ] Baddr - Report writing, perference design process check step 4 on github

- [ ] Mekyle - Build boxes for shapes, slight circular indentation for shapes -> think about colour of boxes -> no lid will 3-d print
- [ ] Mekyle - Write how related work DOES not cover our idea CHECK Github for outline step 3 


- [ ] Yousuf - Build data base, 6 shapes for 6 emotions - think about how we will visualise the data
- [ ] Yousuf - QR code to scan, enter ID provided by device, talk to tom for better idea on what we are thinking
  
- [ ] Oliver - keep writing like a legend - Preferably context and motivation CHECK GITHUB for outline step 1 and 2, we will help you proof read.
